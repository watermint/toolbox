# dropbox team member folder replication

Replicate a folder to another member's personal folder (Irreversible operation)

This command will replicate files under the source folder to the destination folder. The source folder can be a source member's personal folder, a shared folder, or a team folder. But that must be mounted and accessible. This command will overwrite a file if the file already exists on the destination path. 
This command is the one-way copy from source path in a source member, to destination path in destination member. That means the command will not delete the file on the destination path, which deleted on the source path.

# Security

`watermint toolbox` stores credentials into the file system. That is located at below path:

| OS      | Path                                                               |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%HOMEPATH%\.toolbox\secrets` (e.g. C:\Users\bob\.toolbox\secrets) |
| macOS   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /Users/bob/.toolbox/secrets)        |
| Linux   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /home/bob/.toolbox/secrets)         |

Please do not share those files to anyone including Dropbox support.
You can delete those files after use if you want to remove it. If you want to make sure removal of credentials, revoke application access from setting or the admin console.

# Proxy configuration

The executable automatically detects your proxy configuration from the environment. However, if you got an error or you want to specify explicitly, please add -proxy option, like -proxy hostname:port. Currently, the executable doesn't support proxies which require authentication.
