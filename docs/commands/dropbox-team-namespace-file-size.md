# dropbox team namespace file size

Calculate storage usage for files and folders in team namespaces, providing detailed size analytics 

Analyzes storage consumption across team namespaces with configurable depth scanning. Shows size distribution by namespace type (team, shared, member, app folders). Critical for storage optimization, identifying large folders, and planning archival strategies.

# Security

`watermint toolbox` stores credentials into the file system. That is located at below path:

| OS      | Path                                                               |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%HOMEPATH%\.toolbox\secrets` (e.g. C:\Users\bob\.toolbox\secrets) |
| macOS   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /Users/bob/.toolbox/secrets)        |
| Linux   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /home/bob/.toolbox/secrets)         |

Please do not share those files to anyone including Dropbox support.
You can delete those files after use if you want to remove it. If you want to make sure removal of credentials, revoke application access from setting or the admin console.
