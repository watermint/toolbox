cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe file compare account -left left -left-path /path/to/compare -right right -right-path /path/to/compare
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx file compare account -left left -left-path /path/to/compare -right right -right-path /path/to/compare
```
If you want to compare different path in same account, please specify same alias name to `-left` and `-right`.

Note for macOS Catalina 10.15 or above: macOS verifies Developer identity. Currently, `tbx` is not ready for it. Please select "Cancel" on the first dialogue. Then please proceed "System Preference", then open "Security & Privacy", select "General" tab.

# Proxy configuration

The executable automatically detects your proxy configuration from the environment. However, if you got an error or you want to specify explicitly, please add -proxy option, like -proxy hostname:port. Currently, the executable doesn't support proxies which require authentication.
