The watermint toolbox can run from any path in the system if allowed by the system. But the instruction samples are using the Desktop folder. Please replace the path if you placed the binary other than the Desktop folder.

# Usage

```
cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe github tag create -owner OWNER -repository REPO -sha1 SHA -tag TAG
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx github tag create -owner OWNER -repository REPO -sha1 SHA -tag TAG
```

Note for macOS Catalina 10.15 or above: macOS verifies Developer identity. Currently, `tbx` is not ready for it. Please select "Cancel" on the first dialogue. Then please proceed "System Preference", then open "Security & Privacy", select "General" tab.

The command will generate a report in three different formats. `created.csv`, `created.json`, and `created.xlsx`.
