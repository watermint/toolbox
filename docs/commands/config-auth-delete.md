# config auth delete

Delete existing auth credential 

Remove stored authentication credentials for a specific service account. This is useful when you need to revoke access, change accounts, or clean up old authentication tokens. The command requires both the application key name and peer name to identify the credential to delete.

# Installation

Please download the pre-compiled binary from [Latest Release](https://github.com/watermint/toolbox/releases/latest). If you are using Windows, please download the zip file like `tbx-xx.x.xxx-win.zip`. Then, extract the archive and place `tbx.exe` on the Desktop folder. 
The watermint toolbox can run from any path in the system if allowed by the system. But the instruction samples are using the Desktop folder. Please replace the path if you placed the binary other than the Desktop folder.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.

## Run

Windows:
```
cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe config auth delete -key-name KEY_NAME -peer-name PEER_NAME
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx config auth delete -key-name KEY_NAME -peer-name PEER_NAME
```

Note for macOS Catalina 10.15 or above: macOS verifies Developer identity. Currently, `tbx` is not ready for it. Please select "Cancel" on the first dialogue. Then please proceed "System Preference", then open "Security & Privacy", select "General" tab.
You may find the message like:
> "tbx" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.

And you may find the button "Allow Anyway". Please hit the button with your risk. At second run, please hit button "Open" on the dialogue.
