# Installation

Please download the pre-compiled binary from [Latest Release](https://github.com/watermint/toolbox/releases/latest). If you are using Windows, please download the zip file like `tbx-xx.x.xxx-win.zip`. Then, extract the archive and place `tbx.exe` on the Desktop folder. 
The watermint toolbox can run from any path in the system if allowed by the system. But the instruction samples are using the Desktop folder. Please replace the path if you placed the binary other than the Desktop folder.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.

## Run

.\tbx.exe github release asset download -owner OWNER -repository REPO -path /LOCAL/PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD -release RELEASE
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx github release asset download -owner OWNER -repository REPO -path /LOCAL/PATH/TO/DOWNLOAD -release RELEASE
