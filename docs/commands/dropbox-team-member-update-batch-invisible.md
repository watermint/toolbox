# dropbox team member update batch invisible

Hide team members from the directory listing, enhancing privacy for sensitive roles or contractors (Irreversible operation)

Bulk hides members from team directory searches and listings. Useful for executives, security personnel, or external contractors who need access but shouldn't appear in directories. Hidden members retain all functionality but enhanced privacy.

# Security

| Linux   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /home/bob/.toolbox/secrets)         |

Please do not share those files to anyone including Dropbox support.
You can delete those files after use if you want to remove it. If you want to make sure removal of credentials, revoke application access from setting or the admin console.
