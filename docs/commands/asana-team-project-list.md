## Report: projects

A project represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board with columns of tasks represented as cards.
The command will generate a report in three different formats. `projects.csv`, `projects.json`, and `projects.xlsx`.

| Column        | Description                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| gid           | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. |
| resource_type | The base type of this resource.                          |
| name          | Name of the project.                                     |

If you run with `-budget-memory low` option, the command will generate only JSON format report.

In case of a report becomes large, a report in `.xlsx` format will be split into several chunks like follows; `projects_0000.xlsx`, `projects_0001.xlsx`, `projects_0002.xlsx`, ...
