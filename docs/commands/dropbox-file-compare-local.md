# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.

## Run

```
cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe dropbox file compare local -local-path /path/to/local -dropbox-path /path/on/dropbox
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx dropbox file compare local -local-path /path/to/local -dropbox-path /path/on/dropbox

| `-base-path`    | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

If you run with `-budget-memory low` option, the command will generate only JSON format report.

In case of a report become large, a report in `.xlsx` format will be split into several chunks like follows; `diff_0000.xlsx`, `diff_0001.xlsx`, `diff_0002.xlsx`, ...

## Report: skip

This report shows a difference between to folders.
The command will generate a report in three different formats. `skip.csv`, `skip.json`, and `skip.xlsx`.
