# dropbox team legalhold release

Release a legal hold policy and restore normal file operations for affected members and content 

Ends a legal hold policy and removes preservation requirements. Content becomes subject to normal retention and deletion policies again. Use when litigation concludes or preservation is no longer required. The release is logged for audit purposes but cannot be undone.

# Security

|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%HOMEPATH%\.toolbox\secrets` (e.g. C:\Users\bob\.toolbox\secrets) |
| macOS   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /Users/bob/.toolbox/secrets)        |
| Linux   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /home/bob/.toolbox/secrets)         |

Please do not share those files to anyone including Dropbox support.
You can delete those files after use if you want to remove it. If you want to make sure removal of credentials, revoke application access from setting or the admin console.
