The watermint toolbox can run from any path in the system if allowed by the system. But the instruction samples are using the Desktop folder. Please replace the path if you placed the binary other than the Desktop folder.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.

## Run

Windows:
```
cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe dropbox team teamfolder partial replication -src-team-folder-name SRC_TEAMFOLDER_NAME -src-path /REL/PATH/SRC -dst-team-folder-name DST_TEAMFOLDER_NAME -dst-path /REL/PATH/DST
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx dropbox team teamfolder partial replication -src-team-folder-name SRC_TEAMFOLDER_NAME -src-path /REL/PATH/SRC -dst-team-folder-name DST_TEAMFOLDER_NAME -dst-path /REL/PATH/DST
```

Note for macOS Catalina 10.15 or above: macOS verifies Developer identity. Currently, `tbx` is not ready for it. Please select "Cancel" on the first dialogue. Then please proceed "System Preference", then open "Security & Privacy", select "General" tab.
