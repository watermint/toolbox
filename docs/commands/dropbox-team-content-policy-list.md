## Options:

**-base-path**
: Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder..

## Report: policy

This report shows a list of shared folders and team folders with their current policy settings.
The command will generate a report in three different formats. `policy.csv`, `policy.json`, and `policy.xlsx`.

| Column               | Description                                                                                              |

| is_team_folder       | `true` if the folder is a team folder, or inside of a team folder                                        |
| owner_team_name      | Team name of the team that owns the folder                                                               |
| policy_manage_access | Who can add and remove members from this shared folder.                                                  |
