```

# Installation

Please download the pre-compiled binary from [Latest Release](https://github.com/watermint/toolbox/releases/latest). If you are using Windows, please download the zip file like `tbx-xx.x.xxx-win.zip`. Then, extract the archive and place `tbx.exe` on the Desktop folder. 
The watermint toolbox can run from any path in the system if allowed by the system. But the instruction samples are using the Desktop folder. Please replace the path if you placed the binary other than the Desktop folder.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.

## Run

Windows:
```
cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe dev release asseturl -source-owner SRC_OWNER -source-repo SRC_REPO -target-owner TARGET_OWNER -target-repo TARGET_REPO -target-branch TARGET_BRANCH
```

macOS, Linux:
```
$HOME/Desktop/tbx dev release asseturl -source-owner SRC_OWNER -source-repo SRC_REPO -target-owner TARGET_OWNER -target-repo TARGET_REPO -target-branch TARGET_BRANCH
```

Note for macOS Catalina 10.15 or above: macOS verifies Developer identity. Currently, `tbx` is not ready for it. Please select "Cancel" on the first dialogue. Then please proceed "System Preference", then open "Security & Privacy", select "General" tab.
You may find the message like:
> "tbx" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.

And you may find the button "Allow Anyway". Please hit the button with your risk. At second run, please hit button "Open" on the dialogue.
