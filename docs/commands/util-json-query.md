# util json query

Query JSON data 

Please refer to [jq Manual](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/) for the syntax (some features are not supported).

# Installation

Please download the pre-compiled binary from [Latest Release](https://github.com/watermint/toolbox/releases/latest). If you are using Windows, please download the zip file like `tbx-xx.x.xxx-win.zip`. Then, extract the archive and place `tbx.exe` on the Desktop folder. 
The watermint toolbox can run from any path in the system if allowed by the system. But the instruction samples are using the Desktop folder. Please replace the path if you placed the binary other than the Desktop folder.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.

```
cd $HOME\Desktop
.\tbx.exe util json query -path /LOCAL/PATH/TO/DATA.json -query QUERY
```

macOS, Linux:

$HOME/Desktop/tbx util json query -path /LOCAL/PATH/TO/DATA.json -query QUERY

The executable automatically detects your proxy configuration from the environment. However, if you got an error or you want to specify explicitly, please add -proxy option, like -proxy hostname:port. Currently, the executable doesn't support proxies which require authentication.
