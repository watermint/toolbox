| macOS   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /Users/bob/.toolbox/secrets)        |
| Linux   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /home/bob/.toolbox/secrets)         |

Please do not share those files to anyone including Dropbox support.
You can delete those files after use if you want to remove it. If you want to make sure removal of credentials, revoke application access from setting or the admin console.

## Report: tasks

The task is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are centered.
The command will generate a report in three different formats. `tasks.csv`, `tasks.json`, and `tasks.xlsx`.

| Column        | Description                                                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| gid           | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string.                      |
| name          | Name of the task.                                                             |
| resource_type | The base type of this resource.                                               |
| created_at    | The time at which this resource was created.                                  |
| completed     | True if the task is currently marked complete, false if not.                  |
| completed_at  | The time at which this task was completed, or null if the task is incomplete. |
| due_at        | Date and time on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due time. |
| due_on        | Date on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due date.          |

If you run with `-budget-memory low` option, the command will generate only JSON format report.

In case of a report becomes large, a report in `.xlsx` format will be split into several chunks like follows; `tasks_0000.xlsx`, `tasks_0001.xlsx`, `tasks_0002.xlsx`, ...
