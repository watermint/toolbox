# dropbox team backup device status

Track Dropbox Backup status changes for all team devices over a specified period, monitoring backup health and compliance 

Evaluates and reports the latest status of Dropbox Backup per device session from activity logs for a specified time period. If there is no activity during the specified period, it is reported as the value `no_status_update`.
Multiple device sessions may be displayed in the following cases
* If the Dropbox application has been reinstalled.
* If the Dropbox application has not been unlinked (e.g. you initialized the OS without unlinking the Dropbox application).

In that case, please refer to the report `session_info_updated` to see the most recent report. This command does not automatically make this determination, since it is possible that there may be a session with the same hostname by coincidence.

# Security

`watermint toolbox` stores credentials into the file system. That is located at below path:

| OS      | Path                                                               |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%HOMEPATH%\.toolbox\secrets` (e.g. C:\Users\bob\.toolbox\secrets) |
| macOS   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /Users/bob/.toolbox/secrets)        |
| Linux   | `$HOME/.toolbox/secrets` (e.g. /home/bob/.toolbox/secrets)         |

Please do not share those files to anyone including Dropbox support.
You can delete those files after use if you want to remove it. If you want to make sure removal of credentials, revoke application access from setting or the admin console.
