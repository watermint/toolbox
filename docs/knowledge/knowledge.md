| `-base-path`    | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`    | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`  | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path`   | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |
| `-category`    | Restricts search to only the file categories specified (image/document/pdf/spreadsheet/presentation/audio/video/folder/paper/others).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |

| `-base-path`  | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`           | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path`           | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`           | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

# dropbox team activity event

Retrieve detailed team activity event logs with filtering options, essential for security auditing and compliance monitoring 

From release 91, the command parses `-start-time` or `-end-time` as the relative duration from now with the format like "-24h" (24 hours) or "-10m" (10 minutes).
If you wanted to retrieve events every hour, then run like:

```
tbx team activity event -start-time -1h -output json > latest_events.json
```

Then, append the latest part to the entire log if you want.

```
cat latest_events.json >> all.json
```

Or more precisely, retrieve events every hour with some overlap.
```
tbx team activity event -start-time -1h5m -output json > latest_events.json
```

Then, concatenate, and de-duplicate overlapped events:
```
cat all.json latest_events.json | sort -u > _all.json && mv _all.json all.json
```

If you prefer CSV format, then use the `jq` command to convert it.
```
cat latest_events.json | jq -r '[.timestamp, .actor[.actor.".tag"].display_name, .actor[.actor.".tag"].email, .event_type.description, .event_category.".tag", .origin.access_method.end_user.".tag", .origin.geo_location.ip_address, .origin.geo_location.country, .origin.geo_location.city, .involve_non_team_member, (.participants | @text), (.context | @text)] | @csv' >> all.csv
```

# dropbox team backup device status

Track Dropbox Backup status changes for all team devices over a specified period, monitoring backup health and compliance 

Evaluates and reports the latest status of Dropbox Backup per device session from activity logs for a specified time period. If there is no activity during the specified period, it is reported as the value `no_status_update`.
Multiple device sessions may be displayed in the following cases
* If the Dropbox application has been reinstalled.
* If the Dropbox application has not been unlinked (e.g. you initialized the OS without unlinking the Dropbox application).

In that case, please refer to the report `session_info_updated` to see the most recent report. This command does not automatically make this determination, since it is possible that there may be a session with the same hostname by coincidence.

In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

# dropbox team content member size

Calculate member counts for each team folder and shared folder, helping identify heavily accessed content and optimize permissions 

Analyzes folder membership density to identify over-shared content. High member counts may indicate security risks or performance issues. Use to prioritize permission reviews and identify candidates for access restriction or folder restructuring.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.
```
tbx dropbox team content member size 
```

| `-base-path`           | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`          | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`          | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

Title: dropbox team insight scan

# dropbox team insight scan

Perform comprehensive data scanning across your team for analytics and insights generation 

This command collects various team data, such as files in team folders, permissions and shared links, and stores them in a database.
The collected data can be analysed with commands such as `dropbox team insight report teamfoldermember`, or with database tools that support SQLite in general.

About how long a scan takes:

Scanning a team often takes a long time. Especially if there are a large number of files stored, the time is linearly proportional to the number of files. To increase the scanning speed, it is better to use the `-concurrency` option for parallel processing.
However, too much parallelism will increase the error rate from the Dropbox server, so a balance must be considered. According to the results of a few benchmarks, a parallelism level of 12-24 for the `-concurrency` option seems to be a good choice.
The time required for scanning depends on the response of the Dropbox server, but is around 20-30 hours per 10 million files (with `-concurrency 16`).

During the scan, users might delete, move or add files during that time. The command does not aim to capture all those differences and report exact results, but to provide rough information as quickly as possible.


For database file sizes:

As this command retrieves all metadata, including the team's files, the size of the database increases with the size of those metadata. Benchmark results show that the database size is around 10-12 GB per 10 million files stored in the team. Make sure that the path specified by `-database` has enough space before running.


About scan errors:

The Dropbox server may return an error when running the scan. The command will automatically try to re-run the scan several times, but the error may not be resolved for a certain period of time due to server congestion or condition. In that case, the command stops the re-run and records the scan task in the database where the error occurred.
If you want to re-run a failed scan, use the `dropbox team insight scanretry` command to run the scan again.
If the issue is not resolved after repeated re-runs and you want to analyse only the coverage of the current scan, you need to perform an aggregation task before the analysis. Aggregation tasks can be performed with the `dropbox team insight summary` command.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.
```
tbx dropbox team insight scan -database /LOCAL/PATH/TO/database
```

If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path`    | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path`           | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path`           | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

# Results



## Report: deleted

Path
The command will generate a report in three different formats. `deleted.csv`, `deleted.json`, and `deleted.xlsx`.

| Column                       | Description      |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| entry_path                   | Path             |
| entry_shard.file_system_type | File system type |
| entry_shard.shard_id         | Shard ID         |
| entry_shard.attributes       | Shard attributes |



In case of a report becomes large, a report in `.xlsx` format will be split into several chunks like follows; `deleted_0000.xlsx`, `deleted_0001.xlsx`, `deleted_0002.xlsx`, ...

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path.

| `-base-path`    | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions.

| `-base-path` | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

| `-base-path`      | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root      |

| `-base-path`            | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

# dropbox team teamfolder partial replication

Selectively replicate team folder contents to another team, enabling flexible content migration (Irreversible operation)

Copies selected subfolders or files from team folders rather than entire structures. Useful for creating targeted backups, extracting project deliverables, or migrating specific content. More efficient than full replication when only portions are needed.

# Usage

This document uses the Desktop folder for command example.
```
tbx dropbox team teamfolder partial replication -src-team-folder-name SRC_TEAMFOLDER_NAME -src-path /REL/PATH/SRC -dst-team-folder-name DST_TEAMFOLDER_NAME -dst-path /REL/PATH/DST
```

| `-base-path`          | Choose the file path standard. This is an option for Dropbox for Teams in particular. If you are using the personal version of Dropbox, it basically doesn't matter what you choose. In Dropbox for Teams, if you select `home` in the updated team space, a personal folder with your username will be selected. This is convenient for referencing or uploading files in your personal folder, as you don't need to include the folder name with your username in the path. On the other hand, if you specify `root`, you can access all folders with permissions. On the other hand, when accessing your personal folder, you need to specify a path that includes the name of your personal folder. | root    |

# Path variables

Path variables are predefined variables which will be replaced on runtime. For example, if you specify a path with the variable like `{{.DropboxPersonal}}/Pictures`, then the path will be replaced with actual path to Personal Dropbox's folder. But the tool does not guarantee the existence or accuracy.

# Firewall or proxy server settings

The tool automatically detects proxy configuration from the system. However, that may fail or cause misconfiguration. In those cases, please use the `-proxy` option to specify proxy server hostname and port number like `-proxy 192.168.1.1:8080` (for proxy server 192.168.1.1, and the port number 8080). 

Note: This tool does not support proxy servers with any authentication such as Basic authentication or NTLM.

# Performance issue

If the command feels slow or stalled, please try re-run with an option `-verbose`. That will show more detailed progress. But in most cases, the cause is simply you have a larger data to process. Otherwise, you already hit a rate limit from API servers. If you want to see rate limit status, please see capture logs and debug for more details. 

The tool automatically adjusts concurrency to avoid additional limitation from API servers. If you want to see current concurrency, please run the command like below. That will show a current window size (maximum concurrency) per endpoint. The debug message "WaiterStatus" reports current concurrency and window sizes. The map "runners" is for operations currently waiting for a result from API servers. The map "window" is for window size for each endpoint. The map "concurrency" is for current concurrency per endpoint. The below example indicates for the endpoint "https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/file_requests/create", the tool does not allow call that endpoint with the concurrency greater than one. That means it requires operation one by one, and there is no easy workaround to speed up operations.

# Garbled output

If the tool output garbled, please stop the tool with Ctrl+C. This issue usually happens when your console does not have a font to display it. Then, please try to change the font that supports your language. Or, please try the option `-lang en` to overwrite language setting of the tool to English.

In PowerShell, you can change the font with (1) right-click on the title bar, (2) click properties, (3) then choose the font tab, (4) then change to an appropriate font like "MS Gothic."

# Log files

By default, log files are stored under the path "%USERPROFILE%\.toolbox\jobs" (e.g. `C:\Users\USERNAME\.toolbox\jobs`) on windows, or "$HOME/.toolbox/jobs" in Linux or macOS (e.g. `/Users/USERNAME/.toolbox/jobs`). Log files contain information such as (1) Runtime information, e.g. OS type/version/environment variables, (2) Runtime options to the tool (including a copy of input data files), (3) Account information of services such as Dropbox, (4) Request and response data to API servers, (5) Data in services such as file name, metadata, id, URL etc. (depends on the command).

Those logs do not contain password, credentials, or API token. But API tokens are stored under the path "%USERPROFILE%\.toolbox\secrets" (e.g. `C:\Users\USERNAME\.toolbox\secrets`) on windows, or "$HOME/.toolbox/secrets" in Linux or macOS (e.g. `/Users/USERNAME/.toolbox/secrets`). These secrets folder files are obfuscated but please do not share these files to anyone including a service provider support such as Dropbox support.

## Log format

There are several folders and files stored under the `jobs` folder. First, the job folder will be created every run with a name (internally called Job Id) with the format "yyyyMMdd-HHmmSS.xxx". The first part "yyyyMMdd-HHmmSS" is for local date/time of the command start. The second part ".xxx" is the sequential or random three-character ID to avoid conflict with a concurrent run.

Under the job folder, there are subfolders (1) `logs`: runtime logs including request/response data, parameters, or debug information, (2) `reports`: reports folder is for managing generated reports, (3) `kvs`: KVS folder is for runtime database folder. 

On troubleshooting, files under `logs` are essential to understand what happened in runtime. The tool generates several types of logs. Those logs are JSON Lines format. Note: JSON Lines is a format that separate data with line separators. Please see [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) for more detail about the specification.

Some logs are compressed with gzip format. If a log is compressed, then the file has a suffix '.gz'. Additionally, logs such as capture logs and toolbox logs are divided by certain size. If you want to analyze logs, please consider using `job log` commands. For example, `job log last -quiet` will report toolbox logs of the latest job with decompressed and concatenated.

## Debug logs

The tool will record all debug information into debug logs that have a prefix "toolbox". All records have a source code file name and line at the operation. If you find some suspicious error, then go to the source code and debug it. Some troubleshooting requires statistical analysis such as for performance tuning or out of memory. It is better to work with a tool such as `grep` or [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). 

If you want to see heap size data in time series, please run the command like below. Then you can see time + heap size in CSV format.
```
tbx job log last -quiet | jq -r 'select(.msg == "Heap stats") | [.time, .HeapInuse] | @csv'
"2020-11-10T14:55:45.725+0900",18604032
"2020-11-10T14:55:50.725+0900",15130624

"2020-11-10T14:56:35.726+0900",16678912
```

## API transaction logs

The tool will record API requests and responses into capture logs that have a prefix "capture". This capture logs do not contain requests and responses of OAuth. Additionally, API token strings are replaced with `<secret>`.

## Difference between `dropbox team sharedlink cap` and `dropbox team sharedlink update`

Commands `dropbox team sharedlink update` is for setting a value to the shared links. Commands `dropbox team sharedlink cap` is for putting a cap value to the shared links.\nFor example: if you set expiry by `dropbox team sharedlink update expiry` with the expiration date 2021-05-06. The command will update the expiry to 2021-05-06 even if the existing link has a shorter expiration date like 2021-05-04.\nOn the other hand, `dropbox team sharedlink cap expiry` updates links when the link has a longer expiration date, like 2021-05-07.\n\nSimilarly, the command `dropbox team sharedlink cap visibility` will restrict visibility only when the link has less protected visibility. For example, if you want to ensure shared links without passwords are restricted to the team only. `dropbox team sharedlink cap visibility` will update visibility to the team only when a link is public and has no password.

## Example (list links):

List all public links in the team\n\n\n\nResults are stored in CSV, xlsx, and JSON format. You can modify the report for updating shared links.\nIf you are familiar with the command jq, you can create CSV file directly like below.\n\n\n\nList links filtered by link owner email address:\n\n\n

## Example (delete links):

Delete all link that listed in the CSV file\n\n\n\nIf you are familiar with jq command, you can send data directly from the pipe like below (pass single dash `-` to the `-file` option to read from standard input).\n\nInvalid argument: team sharedlink delete links -file -n
Error: <no value>

# Other usecases

## External ID

External ID is the attribute that is not shown in any user interface of Dropbox. This attribute is for keeping a relationship between Dropbox and identity source (e.g. Active Directory, HR database) by identity management software such as Dropbox AD Connector. If you are using Dropbox AD Connector and you built a new Active Directory tree. You may need to clear existing external IDs to disconnect relationships with the old Active Directory tree and the new tree.\nIf you skip clear external IDs, Dropbox AD Connector may unintentionally delete accounts during configuring to the new tree.\nIf you want to see existing external IDs, use the `dropbox team member list` command. But the command will not include external ID by default. Please add the option `-experiment report_all_columns` like below.\n\n\n

# Reporting options

The watermint toolbox creates reports from data obtained from services via the API. The reports differ depending on the command.

* Commands that output data from the API as reports.
* Commands that output data from the API as reports after processing.

The command output format is designed for core use cases. To avoid confusion, the command omits irrelevant/low priority fields.
You can output the abbreviated data using the method shown below, or create a report with your preferred format by using output filter.

# Hidden columns

In the CSV and xlsx reports produced by the command, some columns may be omitted. This includes, for example, internally used IDs and data of little relevance.

```
$ ./tbx dropbox file account info

watermint toolbox xxx.x.xxx

| email                 | email_verified | given_name | surname | display_name |
|-----------------------|----------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| xxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx | true           | xxxx       | xxxx    | xxxxxxxx     |
```

If you want to output this type of data, you can add the `-experiment report_all_columns` option to output all defined columns.

```
$ ./tbx dropbox file account info -experiment report_all_columns

watermint toolbox xxx.x.xxx
===========================

| team_member_id                            | email                 | email_verified | status | given_name | surname | familiar_name | display_name | abbreviated_name | member_folder_id | external_id | account_id                               | persistent_id | joined_on | invited_on | role | tag |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------|------------|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|------------|------|-----|
| dbmid:xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx | xxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx | true           |        | xxxx       | xxxx    | xxxxxxxx      | xxxxxxx     | xxxx             |                  |             | dbid:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx |               |           |            |      |     |
```

Even if you use this option, some information may not be output. If you need more detailed information, try the following output filters.

# Output filter option

This feature allows you to filter the output of the command.
This is useful if you want to process the output in a specific format.

> NOTE: This filter is applied to all output reports. It will not work as intended for commands that output multiple report formats.
> When processing multiple report formats, please use the `util json query` command to process each of the output JSON files.
> 

In addition, in some cases, data in JSON format contains more data.
If you want to retrieve such hidden data, this option will help you to extract it as a report.

For example, the command [dropbox team member list](https://toolbox.watermint.org/commands/dropbox-team-member-list.html) returns a list of team members.
JSON report contains raw data from the Dropbox API.
If you want to extract only the email address and the verification status of the team members, you can use the output filter option.

```
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list -output json --output-filter "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified]"
["sugito@example.com", true]
["kajiwara@example.com", true]
["takimoto@example.com", false]
["ueno@example.com", true]
["tomioka@example.com", false]
```

Then, if you want to format this data as a CSV, you can use the `@csv` filter like this (adding `| @csv` at the end):

```
$ ./tbx dropbox team member list -output json --output-filter "[.profile.email, .profile.email_verified] | @csv"
"sugito@example.com",true
"kajiwara@example.com",true
"takimoto@example.com",false
"ueno@example.com",true
"tomioka@example.com",false
```

In case you want to test the output filter, you can run the command first without the output filter option.\nThe command will generate the raw JSON output.\nThen, you can test the query with the command [util json query](https://toolbox.watermint.org/commands/util-json-query.html) to test the query.\n
